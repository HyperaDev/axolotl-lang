# Axolotl language files

The language files used by Hypera Development's Axolotl Discord bot.

## What is Axolotl?

Axolotl is the Discord bot used by Hypera Development to run our Discord servers.<br/>
In order to make Axolotl super helpful, we have decided to support multiple locales so that users can easily understand
and interact with Axolotl.

This module (`hypera.dev/axolotl-lang/v2`) contains the translatable language files used by Axolotl to display messages
in Discord.

### Supported languages

The current supported locales are:

- [English, UK (en-GB)](locales/en-GB.toml)
- [English, US (en-US)](locales/en-US.toml)
- [日本語 (ja)](locales/ja.toml)

## Contributing

We welcome all contributions! If you have found a mistake or something that can be improved, please feel free to
contribute! If you would like to contribute to this project, please see our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

We are also looking to translate messages into more languages as well! If you know a language that Axolotl does not
currently support, please contribute translations so that we can reach more people who know your language!
